There are three components to the exposure time calculator.

Everything lives in /u/holden/ETC/
The python WSGI code and the supporting data
along with the templates and JS are all under
svn control. A fresh svn co will create a 
directory called expcalc. Currently there is no
tool to install the code (e.g., no makefile.)

1) The backend IDL code and data.
This includes the XIDL source tree and a number of files that 
the ETC needs to compute values.

For XIDL to work, a number of environmental variables need to be 
defined. The default values are in the file ETC/env-for-xidl.
The code itself lives in the idl/ subdirectory. 

Beyond the XIDL installation, there is a directory called data
which contains two sub directories, filters and templates. These contain
data that are required for the code to work.

This lives in the Data/ subdirectory.

These do not need to live in ETC/, as long as the env-for-idl script
is properly configured.

2) the python code 
This lives in wsgi-scripts/ subdirectory.

There are two path requirements.
a) all of the python dependencies for 
web_s2n.wsgi must live in the same directory 
as web_s2n.wsgi.
b) idl_wrapper lives in a subdirectory of the one
that hosts env-for-idl

3) mod_wsgi
This must be install and running in the Apache
web server, of course.

The configuration is controled in a block in
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Two key configuration variables are in this
file.

a) WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi

This means that the WSGI socket will be in
/var/run, NOT /var/run/wsgi, wsgi is a prefix.
The details are here 
http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationIssues

b) second there is a configuration block that controls
the location of the files. This is currently centered
around /u/holden/ETC. This, of course, could be moved 
to /var/www/, for example.

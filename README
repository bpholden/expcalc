This is a web based interface to the ETC built into XIDL.

The software dependencies are listed in the doc directory.
Installation in the doc directory talks about how this code is all
laid out.

The main script is web_s2n.wsgi, as it is mean to run under
the mod_WSGI interface to Apache.  The last line of the Python
code must be:

     application = default_app()

Currently, this is deployed via
/u/holden/ETC/wsgi-scripts/
